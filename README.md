# TalkDown

The TalkDown interactive dialogue and narrative library specification.

## Version

Since this is just a specification, versioning is easy and manual. GitHub Releases will also tag the version history, and you can reference the version from there.

`0.1.0`

## Rationale

> See the [features document](FEATURES.md) for more specific information about the purpose of this software.

There is no good open-source libraries for choice-based narrative and dialogue in interactive media (that we know of). Integrating story into mechanics should be a mission for furthering narrative-based games.

Markdown is a great resource for both writers and developers. This is game development; where writers and developers (and musicians, artists, marketers, and so on) interact frequently. Seems like a perfect match!

That's what this [specification](SPECIFICATION.md) is for!

## Basic Description

> This section is _to-do_ once the specification is completed. This would be a basic idea of how the writer and developers would interact... like a basic example!
